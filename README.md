Multi-Agent Level 2
Level 2  LLM + Basic Tool Use (One Tool Integration)

This project is the second level of a multi-stage AI assignment. At this level, we extend the LLM-only chatbot from Level 1 by integrating a basic calculator tool.

The focus here is on tool usage:
	‚Ä¢	The LLM detects when a math query is asked.
	‚Ä¢	Instead of solving it itself, the LLM delegates the task to a calculator tool.
	‚Ä¢	Non-math queries are still answered directly by the LLM.
	‚Ä¢	Multi-step tool + LLM queries are not supported yet (handled in Level 3).
