Level 2  LLM + Basic Tool Use (One Tool Integration)

This project is the second level of a multi-stage AI assignment. At this level, we extend the LLM-only chatbot from Level 1 by integrating a basic calculator tool.

The focus here is on tool usage:
	•	The LLM detects when a math query is asked.
	•	Instead of solving it itself, the LLM delegates the task to a calculator tool.
	•	Non-math queries are still answered directly by the LLM.
	•	Multi-step tool + LLM queries are not supported yet (handled in Level 3).

 Setup and Installation
	1.	Ensure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed.
	2.	Clone this repository and navigate to the level2 directory.

 	3.	Install dependencies:
 	pip install -r ../requirements.txt
	The requirements.txt includes:
		google-generativeai
		python-dotenv
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	4.create .env file in the same directory with your Gemini api key:
		GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
